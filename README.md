# Display all public GitHub repo traffic graphs

## What it's trying to solve
GitHub users have to go to each GitHub repo to check Traffic views for their repos.

The webpage shows all *public* repo traffic graphs.

## NOTE:
Currently, it displays only my traffic views.
After the first phase is complete (adding a header), I will move onto phase two, which is to let any users to view their stats in one place using GitHub authentication.
